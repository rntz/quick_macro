# This file gives examples of using the quick macro actions. Note that some of
# the commands in this file may conflict with ones from knausj, so you may need
# to rename them either here or in your copy of knausj.

# For example, using the following commands, you'll be able to say "scroll down"
# once, and then scroll further by popping.
scroll up:
  edit.page_up()
  user.quick_macro_set("edit.page_up")
scroll down:
  edit.page_down()
  user.quick_macro_set("edit.page_down")

# Or, you can bind a command to initiate a search, and bind the quick macro to
# finding the next occurrence.
search:
  edit.find()
  user.quick_macro_set("edit.find_next")
